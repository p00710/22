1)Why is HDFS fault-tolerant?
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is fault-tolerant because it replicates data across multiple nodes, allowing it to recover from hardware failures.

2)What is map reduce
MapReduce is a programming model and processing framework for distributed data processing, commonly used in Hadoop, that involves two phases: mapping data and reducing the results.

3)What is cloudera
Cloudera is a company that provides a platform for big data analytics and offers software, support, and services around Hadoop and related technologies

4)What is django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that simplifies web development by providing tools and libraries for building web applications.

5)What is Cassandra
Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database designed for scalability and high availability, used for managing large volumes of data across multiple nodes.

6)What is mongodb
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format and is known for its scalability and flexibility.

7)How is Hadoop and Big Data related?
Hadoop is a framework for processing and storing large datasets, often associated with big data due to its ability to handle massive data volumes.

8)Applications of big data
Applications of big data include improving customer experiences, healthcare analytics, fraud detection, and optimizing supply chains, among others.

9)What is yarn
YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a resource management layer in Hadoop that manages and allocates resources for running applications.

10)Features of Hadoop
Features of Hadoop include scalability, fault tolerance, cost-effectiveness, and the ability to process both structured and unstructured data.

Some of the largest Hadoop users in the world include Facebook, Yahoo, eBay, and Twitter.

12)What is sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text, often used in social media and customer feedback analysis.

13)What is clustering
Clustering is a machine learning technique that groups data points into clusters based on similarity, helping identify patterns or relationships in data.

14)What is pygal
Pygal is a Python library for creating interactive and scalable vector graphics (SVG) charts and graphs.

15)Apriori Algorithm
The Apriori algorithm is a data mining technique used for discovering frequent itemsets in a transaction database.
